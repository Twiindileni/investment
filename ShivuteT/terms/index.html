          <p>Risks

            Market Volatility: Investment in financial markets carries inherent risks, including the potential for loss of principal. Market conditions can change rapidly, affecting the value of investments.
            
            Liquidity Risk: While Horizon Capital aims to process all withdrawal requests within 1 hour, there may be instances where market conditions or other factors impact the liquidity of the fund, delaying withdrawals.
            
            Economic Conditions: Economic factors such as inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events can impact the performance of investments.
            
            Regulatory Changes: Changes in regulatory policies and laws can affect the investment landscape and the value of investments.
            
            Currency Risk: For clients investing in foreign markets, fluctuations in exchange rates can impact the value of investments.
            
            Diversification: Clients should be aware of the importance of diversification in reducing investment risk. Concentrated investments in a single asset or market sector can increase the risk of loss.
            
            Past Performance: Past performance is not indicative of future results. While Horizon Capital aims to provide consistent returns, there is no guarantee of future performance.</p>
